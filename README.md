# League-of-Legends-Investigation

## Introduction

<!-- Provide an introduction to your dataset, and clearly state the one question your project is centered around. Why should readers of your website care about the dataset and your question specifically? Report the number of rows in the dataset, the names of the columns that are relevant to your question, and descriptions of those relevant columns. -->
League of Legends (LoL) is perhaps one of the most popular and well know Massive Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MoBA). This game is played across the world, and has a major South Korea, North America, and Europen pressence. The game premise is very simple, there are two teams with 5 players each, and the objective is destroy your opposing team's base. However, there are many intricacies to the game (such as, champion diversity, items, objectives, etc) that make predicting the winner of games very challeging! Just watch any esports event on LoL, and you will find how deep the game really goes.\

The purpose of this investigation is to answer: Is it possible to predict the outcome of the game, based on a variety of stats collected during the game?\



The dataset I will be using comes from Oracle Elixer, 
From EECS 398 Website: Each 'gameid' corresponds to up to 12 rows â€“ one for each of the 5 players on both teams and 2 containing summary data for the two teams (try to find out what distinguishes those rows). After selecting your line of inquiry, make sure to remove either the player rows or the team rows so as not to have issues later in your analysis.



### Question:
<!-- In other words, is it possible to predict the games outcome at 15 minutes? If so, how much can we be sure? -->
In other words, what champions snow ball the most in the early game? Does their early lead result into wins?
